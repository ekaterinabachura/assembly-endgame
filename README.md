A React implementation of a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden programming-related word within 8 attempts. Failure results in the world being overtaken by Assembly language. Features confetti animations on victory and progressive language elimination mechanics.

### Built With
- **React**  
- **Vite**  
- **CLSX** (class utility)  
- **react-confetti** (victory animation)

## How to Play
1. Guess letters using the on-screen keyboard  
2. Correct letters reveal their positions in the word  
3. Incorrect guesses eliminate programming languages  
4. 8 wrong guesses trigger a "Game Over"  
5. Win by revealing all letters before attempts run out  

Key mechanics:  
- Dynamic language chips with custom colors  
- Hidden word visualization  
- Farewell messages for eliminated languages  
- Responsive keyboard with state tracking
